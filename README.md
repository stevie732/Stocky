## 🛠️ How It Works

The app analyzes stocks based on the following criteria:
1. **📈 Price Change**: Minimum percentage increase in stock price.
2. **📊 Volume**: Minimum trading volume.
3. **📉 RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Identifies overbought or oversold conditions.
4. **💰 P/E Ratio**: Filters stocks with a low price-to-earnings ratio.
5. **💵 Dividend Yield**: Includes stocks with a high dividend yield.

The backend, built with **Flask**, fetches stock data using the `yfinance` library and applies the criteria. The frontend, built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, displays the results in a user-friendly interface.
